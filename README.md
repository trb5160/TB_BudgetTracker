Tom Barber: Budget Tracker

Description: Everyone that has money needs a way to keep track of it.  To help with this, I've developed a simple app that can help the user keep track of their money supply.  The app uses mongodb and node to allow the user to add and subtract money amounts that they've accrewed.  The app then shows a graph of the differnet values that their money has been at by date.
